# square
Square is a Portfolio website made both to practice and showcase my frontend skills.

The original design is from http://theuncreativelab.com/.
Every single line of code, implementations and some ideas
are entirely by me.

I made this to practice with CSS, SASS, Architecture...
Everything you see is made in Pure CSS. No JS involved.
Popups are made with the :target selector hack, respon-
sive menu and other interactive stuff is made with the
checkbox hack.

Sometimes my solutions are extreme and you will probably
find a better and more efficient way to achieve almost
everything I had on this project, but this is my first
serious attempt at building something and I wanted to
challenge myself with pure CSS.

Please feel free to give me advices and/or teach stuff;
this is also my first time uploading something to GitHub
and I still don't know well how it works so any help in
this field too is accepted.
